<b>Recommended with commendation</b>
<p>
Prateek presented his work “ Bayesian Coresets for Personalized Federated Learning” as part of his PhD topic “Towards building Efficient and Robust Methods in LLM Pretraining and Finetuning.” The presented work has been accepted in ICLR 2024 (A* conference). The extension of the ICLR work is submitted to AAAI. Also, another work “Few shot chain-of-thought driven reasoning to prompt LLMs for open-ended medical question answering,” accepted in EMNLP. In summary, the candidate has strong acceptance and submissions at A* conferences and contributes to the BharatGen ecosystem. Furthermore, he is clear about his future work and goals. Further, completed the required TA duties.<ul>

<h2>2023</h2>
<h3>PMRF Reviews</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>Recommended with commendation</b><i>: <q>Prateek has done a thorough literature survey and identified interesting research directions. He has already submitted a paper in ICLR 2024 and received a positive feedback from the conference. The progress is commendable especially because Prateek is a direct PhD candidate. Expect Prateek to continue with the research plan and convert the starts into research publication outcome in the coming one year. The progress seems above satisfactory in terms of efforts and progress. The only reason committee does not recommend commendation (only given selectively) is lack of published articles during this period. The candidate should not be discouraged by this as he has made a significant progress.</i> </q></p>
